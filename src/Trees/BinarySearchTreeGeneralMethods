Binary Search Tree 
(Search / Find, Insert, Traversal, Display, Create, Delete)

1. Recursive Search Method -- 
    a. Search an element 
    b. Search for a node.
2. Iterative Search --
    a. Search for an element.
2. Display Method -- 
3. Recursive Find Minimum -- Find the minimum Node recursively. 
4. Recursive Find Maximum -- Find the maximum node recursively.
5. Iterative Find Minimum -- Find minimum element
6. Iterative Find Maximum -- Find maximum element
7. Recursive Insert Method -- Insert a node recursively
8. Iterative Insert Method -- Insert a node iteratively. 
9. Recursive Delete Method -- Delete a node recursively.
10. Iterative Delete Method -- Delete a node iteratively.  
7. Traversal 
    a. Post Order
    b. Pre Order
    c. In Order
8. Height of the Node. Given a node, find where it is on the tree.
9. Create Tree --
